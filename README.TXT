My second project was to create a class of ‘Employee’
This class models a typical employee who has a name, age, pay scale and several days of holiday entitlement 

This project allowed me to become familiar with the Test Driven Development cycle

This project introduced me to the importance of testing your code whilst you work. 
I had a specific brief of what characteristics an employee had. 
I had to create this correctly, whilst writing tests that would ensure I had followed the brief.
